Iâ€™ve built an app about weather forecast using HTML CSS and JavaScript. This app will help you get information about weather in whatever city you want. Just enter the city name ! You can also get your current location weather details by clicking on the "Get Device Location" button. You'll get many weather details including temperature in celsius, weather conditions, location, feels like, and humidity.
